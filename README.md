# Movie_Wishlist_React
Created with CodeSandbox
You can check how it works here: https://csb-bfk6hi.netlify.app/

App communicates with http://www.omdbapi.com/. 
You can search for movies, add it to wishlist and delete from wishlist.

Api returns only one movie as a search result, thus only one movie can be added to wishlist at a time.
